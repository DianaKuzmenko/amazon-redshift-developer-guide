# LZO Encoding<a name="lzo-encoding"></a>

LZO encoding provides a very high compression ratio with good performance\. LZO encoding works especially well for CHAR and VARCHAR columns that store very long character strings, especially free form text, such as product descriptions, user comments, or JSON strings\. LZO is the default encoding for SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, DECIMAL, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, TIMESTAMP, or TIMESTAMPTZ data types\.
